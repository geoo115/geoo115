# George Saad – Backend Engineer

Go Backend Engineer building production-ready, observable, and secure systems. Before my software career, I owned and operated a restaurant for nearly a decade, where I solved operational problems by engineering a custom MySQL-based inventory system. This experience drives my focus on building practical, impactful technology. I am currently completing a Software Engineering Fellowship at 01Founders in London.
